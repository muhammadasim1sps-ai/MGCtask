ingest.py
---------
This script builds the vector database used for retrieval.

What it does, step by step:
  1. Reads each source document (plain Markdown files in data/).
  2. Splits each document into chunks along its section headings.
  3. Converts each chunk into a vector embedding (sentence-transformers).
  4. Stores the chunk text + embedding + metadata (document name, section)
     in a local ChromaDB collection saved to disk.

Run this once before using the assistant, and again any time the source
documents change:
